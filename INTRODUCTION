The project objective is to book travel tickets in online. The Ticket Reservation System is an Internet based application that can be accessed throughout the Net and can be accessed by anyone who has a net connection. This application will reserve the tickets. This online ticket reservation system provides a website for booking bus, train, hotel and rental tickets where any user of internet can access it. User is required to login to the system and needs a credit card for booking the tickets. Tickets can be collected at the counter, but all this excitement vanishes after standing in hours in long queues to get tickets booked. 
 
The website provides complete information regarding currently available tickets on all the buses, trains, hotels and rentals with details of available seats. Ticket reservations are done using credit card and can be cancelled if needed. Our online tickets reservation system is one of the best opportunities for those who cannot afford enough time to get their tickets reserved standing in long queues. People can book tickets online at any time of day or night. Our reservation system also provides option to 
cancel the tickets which are reserved previously. 
 
The main goal of this app is to provide the quality and affordable travelling website for booking the tickets where ever they are and which ever travelling service they use.
